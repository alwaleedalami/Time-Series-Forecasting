# Financial Time Series Forecasting

## Overview
This project focuses on forecasting financial time series data using classical statistical models. ARIMA and Exponential Smoothing techniques are applied to historical stock price data to analyze trends, temporal dependencies, and short-term forecasting performance.

## Data
The project uses real-world historical stock price data retrieved programmatically. The dataset represents time-ordered financial observations suitable for trend analysis and forecasting.

## Methodology
- Retrieved and prepared financial time series data
- Analyzed temporal patterns and trends
- Built forecasting models using:
  - ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
  - Exponential Smoothing
- Evaluated model performance using RMSE and MAE
- Visualized predicted versus actual values over time

## Results
- Both models captured underlying trends in historical stock prices
- Forecast accuracy was assessed using standard regression-based error metrics
- Visual comparisons highlighted the strengths and limitations of each approach for short-term forecasting

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Statsmodels
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Takeaways
This project demonstrates practical application of time series forecasting techniques on financial data, emphasizing data preparation, model evaluation, and interpretability of results in a real-world context.
